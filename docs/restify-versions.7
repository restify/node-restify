.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Restify versioning enables you to build a REST API that uses versioning the same way you might as an NPM package maintainer\. That is, you specify versions of your API, either as a "blanket" server configuration, or a\-la\-carte on a particular route\. A client MUST then send an x\-api\-version header specifying the version of the route they find acceptable\. This is all opt\-in, so if you don\'t want to run with versioning on, you don\'t have to\.
.
.P
Once you enable versioning, as shown above, you can pass in a \fBversion\fR flag to \fBrestify\.createServer\fR, which will set that version string on all routes automatically\. You can override each route with a different version string\. Note that restify processes routes in the order they are encountered, so the \fIfirst matching\fR route for an x\-api\-version header will be used\. You can explicitly disable versioning on a route by passing in \fBnull\fR as the first parameter\.
.
.P
As to version sytax, two are supported: semver and everything else\. If version is a valid semver header, then the client can send anything they would to npm (e\.g\., \'1\.x || >=2\.5\.0 || 5\.0\.0 \- 7\.2\.3\')\. Restify uses the lovely node\-semver library to parse these\. If version is not a valid semver string, then clients MUST send an exact match\.
.
.P
As mentioned above, if versioning is enabled, clients MUST send an x\-api\-version header describing the route version they want to use\. This avoids the dreaded \'default\' version a service would need to support in perpetuity\.
.
.P
Note that mixing semver and non\-semver version strings will result in undefined behavior\.
.
.P
If there is not a matching version found for a route (but other parameters are valid), a response of \fBHTTP/1\.1 449 Retry with an x\-api\-version header\fR is sent along with an \fBx\-api\-versions\fR header, which contains a list of valid versions for that route\.
